=head1 GENESIS

If you are a web developer such as me, you know that many times you needed to use
html controls that are not directly available in the HTML language.

Every time you needed of use a datetime input control or to validate an input
field you needed to mix html, javascript and cascade style sheet to make what 
you want. And, in every project you needed that, you needed to find all the 
required code for you "advanced" control or you must reinvent the wheel.

This module try to encapsulate these advanced widget so that you can forget all
inside code and substitute with a few lines of perl.

Be aware, the HTML code generated by this module use heavy javascript and css 
code and so are not compatible with all browser. Like every time, you need to
make a compromised between great input feedback and browser compatibility.

HTML code generated by this module has teste with Microsoft(R) Internet Explorer 
5.5 and greater and with Mozilla Firefox 1.0 and greater. Let me know if notice
tis module works in other browser.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To have an idea of what kind of widgets are currently (1.00) available let me 
describe the DATE widget. 

This is a date control built with three combo (select) input field. With these
combos you can select day, month and year.

You can also select date by pressing a button that opens a popup calendar 
(http://www.dynarch.com/projects/calendar/). 

Another way, and this is great for me, is the ability to enter date directly 
with keyboard. If you press a key the combobox becomes a textbox and this give
you the possibility to enter date with keyboard

After that, when you post the form, only an hidden field with the date you set 
in the visible controls, has sent. 

All these layouts (combo/textbox and hidden field) are alway syncronized to have
the same date value.
